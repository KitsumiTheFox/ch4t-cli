# ch4t-cli
A CLI client for http://ch4t.io/ using Node.js.
 * Note for anybody stumbling across this: ch4t.io is NSFW.

## Directions (UNIX/UNIX-Likes only)
There are two versions available: the original `client.js` and the new UI `ncurses.js`.
* Requires `Node.js` and `npm`. 
 * GNU/Linux distributions should have these both available in the offical repositories.
* Git is an optional dependency; it only with cloning this repository.
 * Git should be available from offical repositories in GNU/Linux distributions.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/DoomsdayMuffinz/ch4t-cli.git
$ cd ch4t-cli
$ npm install 
$ node ncurses.js
```
